### MetaResearch


A tool for understanding research.

Based on keywords, authors, or complex language. Searches for the most similar research papers using several methods.
1. Examining the hyper dimensional space of all research, and the structures/clusters within.
2. Examining the trees of research by authorship and citations.
3. Harnessing modern LMs to understand these further and output for users.

### Audience: 
Primary: Researchers
Secondary: Professionals
Tertiary: Everyone, AutoResearch



### Roadmap:
1. Improve current clustering / searching tool - use better embedding/clustering combo, make dendrograms more useful, improve search function, improve summarizaiton.
2. Big data - be able to cheaply handle ~ 10 million papers, perhaps other sources as well
3. Utilize "people trees" as first step - understand fields as a set of important authors and papers with citation trees
